<p>The common sense might consider that there can be <strong>only</strong> one first launch.

<p>The first ever user inside Fitzhì will be the first administrative user, and therefore its owner.<br/>
<em>At the beginning, God enters in Fitzhì and performs all initialization</em>.<br/>
Fitzhì detects the first ever interaction &amp; creates the file <strong>connection.txt</strong> to save &amp; <em>(in a way)</em> celebrate this first connection.<br/>
Then you just have to follow the steppers<br/></p>
