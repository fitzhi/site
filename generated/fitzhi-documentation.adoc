A project in Fitzhì 

* is defined by an `*id*`, and a `*name*`.
* has an url hosting the Git repository set in `*urlRepository*`
* has a `connectionSettings` which might be equal to *1*, or *2*.
** If equal to *1*, the backend will connect to the Git SCM, with the given `*username*` and `*password*`.

IMPORTANT: The password will be encrypted in the project record. For this first release, we assume that the NSA, or a very skilled hacker, might be able to break this code. But we remind you as well that **this projects file is stored on your file system on your own network**.

* ...
** If equal to *2*, the backend will connect to the Git SCM, using a settings file declared in `*filename*`. The location of this file is setup in the `*application.properties*` file.
[source]
----
#
# Local directory where are stored the properties files containing the connection settings to GIT
# Each file contains 3 properties
# - an optional property with the SCM URL
# - a "user" property
# - a "password" property
#
versionControl.ConnectionSettings=../data/application/repository-settings/
----

* the Fitzhì project has the url of the Sonar server deployed on your network `*urlSonarServer*` to validate your own code. 

NOTE: Multiple Sonar servers might be available on your network. This list is declared inside the referential file `*sonar-servers.json*`. *But we assume that your project has not been distributed on multiple servers*. This is a relation (n) Fitzhì projects <-> (1) Sonar server.

* has an array of `*SonarProject*` associated with the Fitzhì project. The applicaiton Fitzhì has declared for example 2 Sonar projects, one for Java, one for Angular.
** Each Sonar project has its own configuration with the chosen evaluation metrics and their relative weights. The file `/deploy/data/referential/*supported-metrics.json*` contains the default template of settings which might be overriden for each project.
** Each Sonar project has an array of `*FileStats*` with the `*language*` and the `*numberOfFiles*`` detected for this language
** A global `*SonarEvaluation*` and the `*totalNumberLinesOfCode*`
