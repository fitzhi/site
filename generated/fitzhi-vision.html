<h2 id="_overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fitzhì aims to gather all technical data regarding your application portfolio into <strong>ONE</strong> single portal.
Of course Fitzhi delivers analysis and assessments at the project scope, but its main target is the portfolio. Our main ambition is to provide a global, and dynamic vision of the technical risk for your IT.
Our killer-feature for Fitzhì should be the ONE single dashboard, one Single Point Point Of Quality, available for the CIO, and ready to resume in one second, one view, the current situation and the historic trend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fitzhi is integrated with existing solutions, such as Sonar&#8482;, but Fitzhì also provides his own assessment tools.<br>
This actual release introduces 3 charts <em>in Beta test</em> :</p>

<h3 id="_the_staff">THE STAFF</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The staff coverage is a build-in feature of Fitzhì.
An important concern regarding your IT legacy is the staff, more precisely the <strong>staff relevant and available</strong> to maintain and develop your applications. Do you have the best team with the required skill &amp; functional knowledge, that prevents anything from falling through the net ?
You need to be able to answer questions such as</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Who has worked on this project ?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Do we still have someone available to fix this issue in this antique application from your legacy</em> ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Does the technical mastery of the actual team cover all parts of the project ? Or do we face some risks there ?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To fulfill that purpose, Fitzhì manages a staff registry with all of your developers.
They are registered as <code>active</code> or <code>inactive</code>, <code>external</code> or not.<br>
Fitzhì will crawl the history of your Git repository, gather your commiters and their operations
 and generates charts like this one below.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>The full green slices are packages with sufficient active developers.</p>

<p>Dark green are desert. Cross your fingers that nothing appends there.</p>

<h3 id="_the_code">THE CODE</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fitzhì links each application with its Sonar&#8482; perspective. It processes a <strong>unique</strong> note, based on metrics affected by their weights. Our application Fitzhì had a note of 72%, long time ago in the past.</p>

<p>Automatic tool cannot completly evaluate your applications.<br>
More or less regularly, experts audit your applications and assess their qualities in terms of good practices on several themes which appear to you to be key and significant for these applications.<br>
In the example below, the <code>General organization</code>, the <code>Build process</code> and the <code>Documentation</code> were considered important for evaluating an application. We could add <code>Performance</code>, <code>Technical design</code>&#8230;&#8203;</p>
