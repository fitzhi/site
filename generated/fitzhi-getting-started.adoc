== GETTING STARTED WITH FITZHI
:nofooter:

[.text-justify] 
The common sense might consider that there can be *only* one first launch. 
In fact, *two* are available for Fitzhì : the first launch and the *very* first launch.


=== THE VERY FIRST START
The first ever user inside Fitzhì will be the first administrative user, and therefore its owner. +
_At the beginning, God enters in Fitzhì and performs all initialization_. +
Fitzhì detects the first ever interaction & creates the file **connection.txt** to save & _(in a way)_ celebrate this first connection. +
Then you just have to follow the steppers +

IMPORTANT: The first panel saves in the permanent local storage the URL of your backend server. Default is localhost:8080. You will have to remove this entry if you plan to move this server _(an entry in the backlog will simplify this operation)_.

==== THE FIRST START 
[.text-justify] 
Each user in Fitzhì will experience a first launch. +
Depending on a property set in file `*application.properties*`, Fitzhi users can self-register themselves, or not. If not, they have to be already created. + 
Default settings allow the self-registration.

# Does Fitzhì allow self registration ?
# Either, everyone can create his own user, by simply connecting to the Fitzhi URL
# Or a login must be already present for each new user in the staff collection.
