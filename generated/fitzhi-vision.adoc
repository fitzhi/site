Fitzhì aims to gather all technical evaluation regarding your application portfolio into a comprehensive Single Point. Our goal is to provide a 10-seconds-dashboard which resumes in one single panel, your current situation and your historic trend. 

* _Which percentage of your portfolio is covered by your actual IT crew ?_
* _Who are the key peoples of your organization regarding their application knowledge ?_
* _What is the Sonar global evaluation for the entire portfolio ?_
* _Which skill is lacking of Senior developer ?_
* _How did the last audit value your application ?_ 
* _Did the actual turnover downgrade our mastery on our own applications ?_
