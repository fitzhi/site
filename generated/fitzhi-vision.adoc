== OVERVIEW
Fitzhì aims to gather all technical data regarding your application portfolio into *ONE* single portal.
Of course Fitzhi delivers analysis and assessments at the project scope, but its main target is the portfolio. Our main ambition is to provide a global, and dynamic vision of the technical risk for your IT. 
Our killer-feature for Fitzhì should be the ONE single dashboard, one Single Point Point Of Quality, available for the CIO, and ready to resume in one second, one view, the current situation and the historic trend. 

Fitzhi is integrated with existing solutions, such as Sonar(TM), but Fitzhì also provides his own assessment tools. +
This actual release introduces 3 charts _in Beta test_ :

.For your portfolio
* the Skills tiles coverage +
* The global Pie view

.For each project
* the Staff Coverage Sunburst


Fitzhì aims to answer multiple questions such as :

* _**Did we technically improve our IT portfolio last year ? **_  
* _Did the actual turnover downgrade, or not, our mastery in our applications ?_
* _What is the code quality evaluation for the whole portfolio ?_
* _Can we globally assess the IT assets of this company over which we just have taken control ?_
* _Who are the key peoples of my organization regarding their application knowledge ?_
* _Which skill is lacking of Senior developer regarding the need of my applications?_
* _Which percentage of your portfolio is covered by your actual IT crew ?_
* _How did the last audit value your application ?_ 

== THE PORTFOLIO

=== THE SKILLS TILES COVERAGE

This Treemap chart below, represents the technical coverage for the portfolio of applications registered in Fitzhì. +
It compares the volume of code of the registered applications and the active teams which are ready to maintain them.

* Each tile represents an ecosystem (with a maximum of 10 tiles), in proportion to its importance in the portfolio.
* Each tile has a color that figures the level of risk on the ecosystem. Green is under control. Red is at high risk. _In the given example, Javascript is better covered than Java. Typescript is risky._
* It is possible to include, or not, the *external* developers inside the analysis.
* It is possible as well to filter your developers starting from a *minimal skill level* (from 1 to 5)
|===

=== THE GLOBAL PIE VIEW
This sector diagram seeks to summarize on a single diagram, the quality of the portfolio on the 3 dimensions currently analyzed by Fitzhì :

* the Staff coverage
* the Code quality
* the global design

Therefore, the pie is divided in 3 parts, and each part has 4 possible sectors of a different size..

== THE PROJECT

[cols="1a,3a", frame="no", grid="rows"]

image::{site}//assets/img/vision/tech-medal.png[200, 192]
|
Each project declared in Fitzhì, has an IT medal, which synthesizes its quality valuation. +
This medal has 3 dimensions : 

* the staff 
* the code
* the global design

|===


=== THE STAFF 
The staff coverage is a build-in feature of Fitzhì.
An important concern regarding your IT legacy is the staff, more precisely the **staff relevant and available** to maintain and develop your applications. Do you have the best team with the required skill & functional knowledge, that prevents anything from falling through the net ?
You need to be able to answer questions such as 

* _Who has worked on this project ?_
* _Do we still have someone available to fix this issue in this antique application from your legacy_ ?
* _Does the technical mastery of the actual team cover all parts of the project ? Or do we face some risks there ?_

To fulfill that purpose, Fitzhì manages a staff registry with all of your developers. 
They are registered as `active` or `inactive`, `external` or not. +
Fitzhì will crawl the history of your Git repository, gather your commiters and their operations 
 and generates charts like this one below.

* The full green slices are packages with sufficient active developers.
* Dark green are desert. Cross your fingers that nothing appends there.  

=== THE CODE
Fitzhì links each application with its Sonar(TM) perspective. It processes a *unique* note, based on metrics affected by their weights. Our application Fitzhì had a note of 72%, long time ago in the past.

=== THE DESIGN
Automatic tool cannot completly evaluate your applications. +
More or less regularly, experts audit your applications and assess their qualities in terms of good practices on several themes which appear to you to be key and significant for these applications. +
In the example below, the `General organization`, the `Build process` and the `Documentation` were considered important for evaluating an application. We could add `Performance`, `Technical design`...

In the end a score is assigned which summarizes the technical evaluation of an application according to expert opinions.
