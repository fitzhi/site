= OUR AMBITION WITH FITZHÌ
:nofooter:

== OVERVIEW
Fitzhì aims to gather all technical evaluation regarding your application portfolio into a comprehensive Single Point. Our goal is to provide a 10-seconds-dashboard which resumes in one single panel, your current situation and your historic trend. 

* _Which percentage of your portfolio is covered by your actual IT crew ?_
* _Who are the key peoples of your organization regarding their application knowledge ?_
* _What is the Sonar global evaluation for the entire portfolio ?_
* _Which skill is lacking of Senior developer ?_
* _How did the last audit value your application ?_ 
* _Did the actual turnover downgrade our mastery on our own applications ?_

Every project declared in Fitzhì, has an IT medal which synthesize its technical state. +
This medal is summarizing 3 evaluations : the Staff, the Sonar, the Audit

== THE STAFF 
Primary concern regarding an application is the staff active, e.g. the **team available** to maintain the source code, the team with the required skill & functional knowledge. +
You need to be able to answer questions such as 

* _Who has worked on this project ?_
* _Who's still here_ ?
* _Do we still have someone available to fix this issue in this core feature_ ?
* _Does the technical mastery of the actual team cover all parts of the project ? Or do we face some risk there ?_

To fulfill that purpose, Fitzhì manages a staff registry with all of your developers. 
They are registeted as `active` or `inactive`, `external` or not. +
Fitzhì crawls your Git repository and generates charts like this one below.

* Full green slices are packages with sufficient active developers.
* Dark green are desert.
