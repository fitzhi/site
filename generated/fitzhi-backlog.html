<p>You&#8217;ll find below new features &amp; which list. We have not yet arbitrated between all these improvements.
This list is ordered arbitrary. This is in no way an indication of importance.</p>

<h5 id="_perfect_view">Perfect view</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We strive to develop the best synthesis to reflect the general technical situation of an application portfolio. The current version offers a sector diagram.</p>

<h5 id="_support_of_tfs">Support of TFS</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We plan to support TFS as version control system and open Fitzhì to the .Net Ecosystem.</p>

<h5 id="_technical_age">Technical age</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We plan to measure the technical age of a project and the average age of an asset. We can say, as an example, that a Struts application that would be maintained and still active in 2019, has an real age of 1 year and a technical age of 20. This measure would give an obsolescence indicator for your IT, from the technical point of view.</p>

<h5 id="_skills_level">Skills level</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We plan to evaluate the skill level of developers per language from the <strong>GIT</strong> point of view. Of course, nothing beats self-assessment, or peer assessment. But based on 4 years of commit of a developer, Fitzhì might be able to reach an idea on his level in <strong>Java</strong>, or <strong>Spring</strong>&#8230;&#8203;</p>
