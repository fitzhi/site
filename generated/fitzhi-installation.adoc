== OVERVIEW
:nofooter:

The architecture of Fitzhì is quite simple.

* A Javascript frontend which might be launched from a remote host
* A Backend which has to be installed on a computer inside your network.

== INSTALLATION OF FITZHI

=== Installation in a Docker cointainer

You can download a Docker container of the Fitzhi application directly from http://hub.docker.com/u/fitzhi/. 
The current tag is 1.6.

.Download Docker container
[source, shell]
----
docker pull fitzhi/application:1.6
----

The Fitzhi container constains :

- a `Java` `Spring` rest server 
- an `Angular` application
- an `nginx` instance 
- a `Git` client

Fitzhi can be linked with a Sonar server, if any. This component is not mandatory.
Each Sonar server is considered as a source of information useful to reach the project.
The connection settings to access your Sonar server from inside the container has to be provided at startup of your container.

The parameters are :

|===
| **Parameter name** |**Description**
|urlSonarServer
|URL where the Sonar server is deployed.

|login
|The recommended authentification credential : the Sonar token login. This token has been generated by the Sonar security module.

|user
|The alternative connection mode. First authentification credential : user/password. User required to be identified by Sonar. Default is "admin"

|password
|Password required to be identified in Sonar. This property is mandatory if the connection is made with the pair user/password

|===

Fitzhi shares its internal deployment directory `/fitzhi/deploy/` with your host machine.

.Starting the Fitzhì application.
[source, shell]
----
docker run --name fitzhi \
-e "urlSonarServer=http://yourSonarHostname:9000/sonar" \
-e "login=youLoginTokenToSonar" \
-v ~/yourLocalStorage:/fitzhi/deploy/ \
-p 80:80 -d --rm fitzhi/application:1.6
----

.Starting the Fitzhì application with the alternative mode.
[source, shell]
----
docker run --name fitzhi \
-e "urlSonarServer=http://yourSonarHostname:9000/sonar" \
-e "user=youSonarUser" \
-e "password=yourSonarPassword" \
-v ~/yourLocalStorage:/fitzhi/deploy/ \
-p 80:80 -d --rm fitzhi/application:1.6
----


=== Direct installation on a local server

You just have to download the executable of Fitzhì.
[source, shell]
----
curl --insecure https://spoq.fitzhi.com/release/back-fitzhi.zip --output deploy.zip
tar xvf deploy.zip
cd ./deploy/backend-fitzhi/
----

To start the Rest backend server, just type :
[source, shell]
----
java -Xmx1g -jar fitzhi.jar --spring.profiles.active=HTTP
----


=== Direct build and installation on a local server

First of all, you will need to export the GitHub repository.

.Download the source of Fitzhì
[source, shell]
----
git clone https://www.github.com/fitzhi/application.git
rm -rf .git
----

A directory Application will be downloaded with this content :

* front-fitzhi (the Angular front-end project)
* back-fitzhi  (the Spring back-end project)

==== BACK-END INSTALLATION

fitzhì has the following prerequisites:::
* Java 8 or higher
* Maven 3 or higher
* Git 2 or higher installed on the back-end server


The installation of the back-end is very simple. Just type :

[source, shell]
----
cd application
./init.sh
----

|===
|Directory |Version
|deploy
|Main deployment directory
|deploy/backend-fitzhi
|the directory of the executable fitzhì.jar
|deploy/data
|the data directories used by fitzhì
|deploy/data/application
|the data directories where your corporate data will be stored (e.g. staff.json, project.json & skill.json). All of your updates will be stored there.
|deploy/data/referential
|the referential data which contains the static data used by the application
|deploy/data/repos
|the directory which contains all local GIT repositories
|===

You can copy the deploy directory on a remote server, or leave it, on your machine, for testing purpose.
The back-end URL, therefore, will be http://localhost:8080 if you start the server in HTTP mode, and 
http://localhost:8443 in HTTPS mode.


To start the back-end fitzhì, just type:
[source, shell]
----
./run.sh HTTP (or HTTPS)
----


To test if the server is started, just visit the url http://localhost:8080/api/test/ping[window=_blank] , or http://hostname:8080/api/test/ping  +
A **Pong** response is expected.


==== FRONT-END INSTALLATION

The easiest installation involved no-installation. +
The last stable release of front-fitzhì is available here https://fitzhi.github.io/spoq[window=_blank]. +
This URL hosts only a static web server which delivers JS files. So just go there.

If you prefer to deploy the front-end on-premise, like any other Angular application. +
Just type 
[source, shell]
----
cd front-fitzhi
npm install
ng build --prod 
----

A *dist* (by default) directory will be created. +
Just copy everything within the output folder to a folder on your server.
For more precision, just RTFM, https://angular.io/guide/deployment

=== THE BROWER AND THE CORS ISSUE
If you are not familiar with the mechanism of CORS, you can refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[this simple presentation, window=_blank]. +
This protection feature is activated inside your browser, when your executes multiple cross-domain requests. +
With Fitzhì, you have 2 cross domain sources.

* Your single back-end of Fitzhì
* The Sonar server(s) available on your network.

Therefore you might have have to configure 2 types of servers.


==== THE PIRATE WAY
The first solution, and the simplest one, is **NO SECURITY, NO PROBLEM WITH SECURITY...** +
*For testing purpose*, your can disable the CORS protection inside your browser. 

With Chrome, you just need to pass the argument `--disable-web-security` at start-up. +
A startup file `*chrome.sh*`, is provided in the project folder. 

* Control that no instance of Chrome is running
* and then just launch that script.

CAUTION: Avoid using that instance to surf on the Web.

==== THE BACKEND OF FITZHÌ
You will setup your CORS policy with the property `*allowedOrigins*` located in the `*application.properties*` file. +
You will find below an extract from this file.

[source]
----
#
# This property is necessary to declare the host from where the front-end will access this server.
# In order to prevent any CORS exception, you have to setup your front-end URL.
# Default setting accepts 2 URL :
# - The local default URL is you have installed the front-end directly on your machine
# - the https://spoq.io hosting the front-end on the WWW
#
allowedOrigins=http://localhost:4200,https://spoq.io
----

===== THE SONAR CONFIGURATION

====== ALLOWING THE FITZHI ORIGIN INTO SONAR

Sonar server is deployed on a Tomcat server. +
Therefore, the CORS policy of Sonar is in fact the CORS policy of Tomcat, which stands in the file `*web.xml*`.

You just need to declare the CORS filter and its settings. +
Your can add the lines below to your `web.xml` file. We guess that these tag are enoughly explicit.

https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/filter.html#CORS_Filter[You can refer to this documentation if you need further explanation, window=_blank].

[source, xml]
----
<filter>
	<filter-name>CorsFilter</filter-name>
	<filter-class>org.apache.catalina.filters.CorsFilter</filter-class>
	<init-param>
		<param-name>cors.allowed.origins</param-name>
		<param-value>http://localhost:4200, https://spoq.io</param-value>

	<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>

----

WARNING: For some unexplained reason, some versions of Sonar are inert with respect to these parameters. The installation of a reverse proxy, such as NGINX becomes essential.

===== ALLOWING THE FITZHI ORIGIN FROM SONAR

First, you need to download link:http://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/index.html[NGINX, window=_blank] if you have not. 

TIP: NGINX is not a prerequisite, you can use either Apache, or Haproxy, or any other solution as well.

After installation, the configuration is very simple. You just have to configure the **nginx.conf** file as below. 
With this setting, your appplication will be available at http://localhost:8081
[source, json]
----
server {
	listen       8081;
	server_name  localhost;

	location / {
		root   /the/path/to/your/application/dir;
		index  index.html index.htm;
	}

	location /api {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;

          proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

          # When we create new entitiy like 'project',the API returns a 201 response with a 'location' header
          # We add this setting to ensure that the https scheme is present in the response 
          # cf. http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_redirect
          proxy_redirect http://$host https://$host;

          # These 3 settings are set to enable the event-stream flow from the server
          # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13672743/eventsource-server-sent-events-through-nginx
          proxy_set_header Connection '';
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          chunked_transfer_encoding off;
	}
	
	location /sonarqube {
		proxy_pass http://localhost:9000/sonarqube;
		
		proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
	}
}
----

CAUTION: The sonar-servers.json file contains the list of all Sonar servers available on your network. This file is hosted on the Fitzhi backend server. It should contain the URL(s) of the Sonar instance(s) FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE WEB BROWSER. In the case above, your Sonar server will be declared at http://localhost:8081/sonarqube 

We assume in this configuration file that your Sonar instance is located behind the url http://localhost:9000/sonarqube. Your **sonar.properties** has these settings :

[source, json]
----
# Web context. When set, it must start with forward slash (for example /sonarqube).
# The default value is root context (empty value).
sonar.web.context=/sonarqube
# TCP port for incoming HTTP connections. Default value is 9000.
sonar.web.port=9000

=== FIRST START OF FITZHI

The common sense might consider that there can be *only* one first launch. 
In fact, *two* are available for Fitzhì : the first launch and the *very* first launch. +


==== THE VERY FIRST START
The first ever user inside Fitzhì will be the first administrative user, and therefore its owner. +
_At the beginning, God enters in Fitzhì and performs all initialization_. +
Fitzhì detects the first ever interaction & creates the file **connection.txt** to save & _(in a way)_ celebrate this first connection. +
Then you just have to follow the steppers +

image::/assets/img/installation/very-first-connection-1.png[600,500]

IMPORTANT: The first panel saves in the permanent local storage the URL of your backend server. Default is localhost:8080. You will have to remove this entry if you plan to move this server _(an entry in the backlog will simplify this operation)_.

==== THE FIRST START 
Each user in Fitzhì will experience a first launch. +
Depending on a property set in file `*application.properties*`, Fitzhi users can self-register themselves, or not. If not, they have to be already created _(Yogi Berrism, Una perogrullada, Une verità lapalissiana, une lapalissade, Een waarheid als een koe, Tårta på tårta)_. + 
Default settings allow the self-registration.

[source]
....
#
# Does Fitzhì allow self registration ?
# Either, everyone can create his own user, by simply connecting to the Fitzhi URL
# Or a login must be already present for each new user in the staff collection.
#
allowSelfRegistration=true
....
