= STARTING WITH FITZHÌ

== INSTALLATION

First of all, you will need to export the GitHub repository.

. Download fitzhì
[source, shell]
---
git clone https://github.com/frvidal/fitzhì.git
rm -rf .git
---

A directory fitzhì will be downloaded with this content :

* front-fitzhi (the Angular front-end project)
* back-fitzhi  (the Spring back-end project)

=== BACK-END INSTALLATION

fitzhì has the following prerequisites:::
* Java 8 or higher
* Maven 3 or higher
* Git 2 or higher installed on the back-end server


The installation of the back-end is very simple. Just type :

[source, shell]
----
cd fitzhì
./init.sh
----

|===
|Directory |Version
|deploy
|Main deployment directory
|deploy/backend-fitzhì
|the directory of the executable fitzhì.jar
|deploy/data
|the data directories used by fitzhì
|deploy/data/application
|the data directories where your corporate data will be stored (e.g. staff.json, project.json & skill.json). 
All of your updates will be stored there.
|deploy/data/referential
|the referential data which contains the static data used by the application
|===

You can copy the deploy directory on a remote server, or leave it, on your machine, for testing purpose.
The back-end URL, therefore, will be http://localhost:8080 


To start the back-end fitzhì, just type:
[source, shell]
----
deploy/backend-fitzhì/fitzhì.jar 
----

To test if the server is started, just visit the url http://localhost:8080/ping , or http://<<hostname>>:8080/ping  
 


=== FRONT-END INSTALLATION

The easiest installation involved no-installation. +
The last stable release of front-fitzhì is available here https://frvidal.github.io/fitzhì/ . +
This URL hosts only a static web server which delivers JS files. So just go there.

If you prefer to deploy the front-end on-premise, like any other Angular application. +
Just type 
[source, shell]
----
cd front-fitzhì
ng build --prod 
----

A *dist* (by default) directory will be created. +
Just copy everything within the output folder to a folder on your server.
For more precision, just RTFM, https://angular.io/guide/deployment

 
== FIRST LAUNCH OF fitzhì

The common sense might consider that there only can be one first launch. 
In fact, *two* are available with Lombok : the first launch and the *very* first launch. +


=== THE VERY FIRST LAUNCH
The first user of Lombok will the first administrative user. +
